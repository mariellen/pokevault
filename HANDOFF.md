## 🔴 NEEDS YOU NOW

### Evolved-form Supabase persistence (#41, v3.5.57)
**Status:** Implemented on `feature/evolved-form-supabase-persistence`. Persists `evolved_form_g/u/l`
so the #39 form-aware nick (Lycanroc Day/Night/Dusk, Burmy cloak) survives a cloud round-trip.
**Migration already run** by you in the Supabase SQL editor (`ALTER TABLE pokemon_collection ADD
COLUMN … evolved_form_g/u/l`). Code: save payload + `COLLECTION_DB_FIELDS` + a new pure
`cloudRowToCsvRow` helper (extracted from app.js) that **restores `Form (G/U/L)` from
`evolved_form_*`** — the real bug was app.js hardcoding those to `''` on every cloud load, which
the brief missed. Brief also had the table name wrong (`pokemon` → `pokemon_collection`) and
mislocated Step 3; see deviations in the impl summary. Suite green: 770 passed / 2 skipped / 1 todo
(+4 new #41 tests). v3.5.56 → v3.5.57.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Review + merge https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/42 . Migration is already
applied, so it's safe to deploy on merge. See `reviews/evolved-form-supabase-persistence-impl-summary.md`.

### Form-aware evo-target identity (#39, v3.5.56)
**Status:** Implemented on `feature/evolved-form-in-nick`. `slotEvoTarget(p, lg)` makes evo-target
identity form-aware so Lycanroc's Midday/Midnight/Dusk each win an independent keeper slot on a
different physical Rockruff (no more one-Rockruff-holds-Great-Midnight-AND-Ultra-Midday). Plus the
inverse Burmy→Wormadam cloak carve-out (no confidently-wrong `Plnt` nick; FORMSET 📝 review star).
Suite GREEN: 732 passed / 36 skipped / 1 todo. 11 new assertions (A1–A11). Caught + fixed one
pre-existing tracked regression (`lycanroc_fixture.csv` Group E). See
`reviews/evolved-form-in-nick-v3-impl-summary.md`.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Review and merge https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/40
_Updated: 23 Jun 2026_

### Dmax/Gmax Rules (Issue #30)
**Status:** Ruleset fully defined (see Issue #30). Brief file needed at `briefs/dmax-gmax-league-rules-refinement.md` before pipeline dispatch.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Create brief locally, then dispatch via pipeline (OPUS-FIRST). Version target: v3.5.54.
_Updated: 21 Jun 2026_

### Dynamax Master Flag
**Status:** Implementation complete — Opus approved. PR #27 open, awaiting CI + merge.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Check CI is green on PR #27 then merge.
_Updated: 21 Jun 2026_

### GA4 Event Tracking
**Status:** PR #12 open — adds auth.js sign_in/sign_out tracking + 10-test tracking suite. GA4 helpers already shipped in PR #11. Minor conflict expected on version (both ga4 and sort bump to v3.5.47 from same base).
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Review and merge https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/12
_Updated: 13 Jun 2026_

### Sort Scan Date
**Status:** PR #13 open — adds 19-test sort-scan-date suite. Sort helpers already shipped in PR #11. Version conflict note: bump to v3.5.47, same as PR #12 — whichever merges second needs a quick rebase to v3.5.48.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Review and merge https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/13
_Updated: 13 Jun 2026_

### Refactor Redirect Cleanup
**Status:** PR #10 open — CloudFront Function for /pokevault-refactor/* redirect + infra scaffolding.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** Review and merge https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/10 (requires CloudFront deploy after merge)
_Updated: 13 Jun 2026_

## ⏳ WAITING FOR AN AGENT

### Gmax Master Flag Debug (#35, v3.5.55)
**Status:** Diagnosed + closed. The reported symptom (a capped-slot-winning Gmax showing the
capped nick `PersiU100Ⓧ` instead of `NameⓂ{IV%}Ⓧ`) is the **deployed v3.5.53 behaviour** —
`origin/main` has NO `wonGigantamaxMaster`. The fix already exists on this branch (v3.5.54,
commit `ed96ba9`: adds the flag + routes it above `hasLeagueSlot`). Verified against the brief's
real Meowth/Persian example via the engine: best Gmax → `PersianⓂ98Ⓧ` keep; lower Gmax →
`PersianⓇ82Ⓧ` keep. **No engine change needed.** Added the missing regression: first TWO-stage
gmax test (`gmax_master_overrides_capped_slot` in `analyse.gmax_master.test.js`; all prior gmax
tests used single-stage Electabuzz). Bumped v3.5.54 → v3.5.55. Suite green: 754 passed / 2
skipped (untracked `csp.test.js` is the separate CSP thread). Pushed commit `3f41fe1`.
**Owner:** YOU
**Next action:** #35 is fixed by merging the open Dmax/Gmax PR (this same branch,
`feature/dmax-gmax-league-rules-refinement`) to deploy it. See
`reviews/gmax-master-flag-debug-impl-summary.md`.
_Updated: 22 Jun 2026_

### Bug Batch June 2026 — Bugs 3–7
**Status:** Bugs 1 & 2 implemented (v3.5.50). Bugs 3–7 have NO Opus guidance and are NOT implemented. Opus review was truncated after Bug 2. See `reviews/bug-batch-june-2026-impl-summary.md`.

### Dmax/Gmax League Rules Refinement (#30, v3.5.54)
**Status:** Implementation complete — awaiting Opus post-check. Removed the spurious `|dynamax`
capped sub-group (PR #27 over-keep bug) so Dmax/Gmax now compete in the **main capped pool**
with a type-priority tiebreak (Shiny Gmax > Gmax > Shiny Dmax > Dmax > Shiny Normal > Normal);
added full Gigantamax Master parity (`wonGigantamaxMaster`), categorical Normal-Master
suppression when a family has any Gmax (hundo → grey star `NameⓇ{IV%}Ⓗ`; non-hundo → cull/review),
and Lucky-non-winner handling (`NameⓇ{IV%}`, no star, never traded). New `analyse.gmax_master.test.js`
(20 tests). Full suite green: **752 passed / 1 skipped**, only the unrelated untracked
`csp.test.js` fails (pre-existing, not in this branch). 3 documented deviations from Opus
(non-winner nick → `Ⓡ{IV%}`; no `masterDemoted` on Gmax suppression; raid Dmax/Gmax get no star)
+ 2 open questions — see `reviews/dmax-gmax-league-rules-refinement-impl-summary.md`.
**Owner:** PIPELINE
**Next action:** Opus post-check, then open PR (gh CLI not installed — create at
https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/new/feature/dmax-gmax-league-rules-refinement ).
Branch pushed (commit 6ec3d62). Resolve open question on `|lucky` pooling
(lone-Lucky-vs-higher-type) — see impl-summary §5.
_Updated: 21 Jun 2026_

### Dynamax Master Flag
**Status:** Implementation complete — awaiting Opus post-check. Engine + RULES.md already shipped in commit e63ca7a (v3.5.51); this pass verified behaviour against the Electabuzz golden case and closed two gaps in Opus's required-test list (added `dmax_excluded_from_regular_master` full form + `dmax_all_kept_none_traded`, 8→10 tests in analyse.dynamax_master.test.js). Full suite green: 713 passed / 1 skipped excluding the unrelated untracked csp.test.js.
**Owner:** PIPELINE
**Next action:** Opus post-check from Bug 3 onwards. PR: https://github.com/mariellen/pokevault/pull/18
_Updated: 21 Jun 2026_
